# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

This application is a full stack javascript program, built end to end, to demonstrate skill in building a client using React, an Express server, while utilizing other tools such as HTML, postreSQL, RESTful APIs, Bootstrap, Knex, and Node. Eight different user stories were analyzed and implemented in building this app.

## Restaurant Reservations
The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning reservation application for a restaurant. Using this application, you can:

### View a list of current reservations
This allows the user to view how many reservations the restaurant currently has.

### Create new reservations and modify existing reservations
This allows the user to create new reservations or modify existing reservations, within the timeframes of the restaurant's hours of operation.

### Create new tables for reservations
This allows the user to create more tables within the app as new tables are implemented in the restaurant.

### Search for a reservation by phone number
This allows the user to look up a reservation by the phone number given for it.

### Change status of table
This allows the user to change the status of a table by either "seating" a new reservation at that table or "finishing" the current reservation of any given table, freeing it up for future reservations.
